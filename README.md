# hello-world
Simple place where I can store my ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others :-)

I am a frontend-developer, graphic designer and online marketing specialist based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. I recently graduated my studies and have a few years of experience with various projects. I am passionate about photography, visual communication and research.
